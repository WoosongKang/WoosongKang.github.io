      "summary": "This paper presents a periodic running control strategy based on a modified Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model to achieve stable running at various velocities. This model simplifies the analytical representation of the stance phase and defines the required swept angle for maintaining periodic motion during the flight phase. Using this model, we develop a feedback control system that ensures the stability of QLSLIP-based periodic locomotion, even in the presence of external disturbances."
