I am currently a researcher at the Korea Institute of Machinery & Materials (KIMM). In a few weeks, I will become the CEO of ROBOCON, a company providing algorithm solutions. 

As a robotics engineer, I envision a society where humans and robots coexist harmoniously. My goal is to create robots that can adapt to the complex environments humans have built and enhance the quality of human life. My specific interest has always been in robust control of walking robots and implementing various tasks for them, such as jumping and running. To achieve this, I have worked on various robots, from actuators to the design and control of robots, and I have developed algorithms for their operation.

Previously, I pursued a Master's degree in Professor Sehoon Oh's lab at DGIST (Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology), where I conducted research on the locomotion of quadrupedal robots. I completed my Bachelor's degree at DGIST and graduated a science high school.

In addition to my professional interests, I am personally passionate about the history of robotics. I also enjoy singing, drinking whiskey, and creating cocktails in my spare time.
